## ES 3

Unless I **hadn’t passed** (not pass) my exams in June, next year I **will be** (be) my last year in secondary school, so I have to decide what to do. If my French **were** (be) better, I **would study** (study) at the university in Lausanne, where my cousins live. Well, I know Switzerland is very different, so maybe I **wouldn’t like** (not like) it anyway.  
Unfortunately, my Maths marks have never been very good. If I **had done** (do) better in Maths, I **would have taken** (take) a special course in ICT, but I wasn’t admitted. My best marks are in Biology and Chemistry, so if I **pass** (pass) the entrance test, I **will study** (study) Medicine at university, but I don’t know where yet.  
If I **become** (become) a doctor, I **can help** (can help) people and I **will earn** (earn) a good salary.  
I know how bad unemployment is getting, so if I **don’t enter** (not enter) medical school, I **will try** (try) something practical – maybe I **will become** (become) a carpenter like my best friend Jon.  
If I **wanted** (want) to do the same thing, he **would be** (be) really happy. I think that I **would enjoy** (enjoy) that too!
